## Resources Created

### aws_s3_bucket.main

**Type:** `aws_s3_bucket`  
**Name:** `main`  

---

#### 🎯 What This Resource Does

An S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket provides object storage with unlimited capacity. It can store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web.

**In Your Environment:**  
Storing data in bucket 'main'


#### 🤔 Why It Was Created

This resource was generated based on your infrastructure request. S3 is fundamental for storing files, backups, logs, static website content, and data for analytics. It's one of the most commonly used AWS services.

#### ⚙️ How It Works

S3 organizes data as objects within buckets. Each object consists of data, metadata, and a unique identifier (key). Data is automatically replicated across multiple availability zones for 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability.

#### 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Public access blocked by default** - Review bucket policies carefully
- Enable versioning to protect against accidental deletions
- Enable encryption at rest (AES-256 or KMS)
- Use bucket policies and IAM roles to control access
- Enable access logging for audit trails
- Consider enabling MFA Delete for extra protection

#### 💰 Cost Implications

- **Storage costs** vary by storage class (Standard, IA, Glacier, etc.)
- **Request costs** for PUT, GET, LIST operations
- **Data transfer costs** for outbound data
- **Typical cost**: ~$0.023/GB/month for Standard storage
- Use lifecycle policies to automatically move old data to cheaper storage classes

#### 🔗 Dependencies & Relationships

- No required dependencies (can be created standalone)
- Often used with: CloudFront (CDN), Lambda (processing), IAM roles (access control)
- May trigger: S3 event notifications → Lambda/SNS/SQS

#### ✅ Review Checklist

Before deploying this resource, verify:

- [ ] Bucket name is globally unique and follows DNS naming rules
- [ ] Versioning enabled if you need to recover old versions
- [ ] Encryption enabled (at rest and in transit)
- [ ] Public access blocked unless specifically needed
- [ ] Lifecycle policies configured for cost optimization
- [ ] Access logging enabled for compliance
- [ ] Replication configured if disaster recovery is needed
